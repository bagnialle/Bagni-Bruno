            INTRODUZIONE
        </h3>
        <p>The personal computer was the most important invention in the digital revolution, transforming the way we live, work and communicate. Originally, computers were machines reserved for a privileged few, but the introduction of the PC made the technology accessible to all. This change was possible thanks to the contributions of pioneers such as Alan Turing, John von Neumann and Douglas Engelbart.

            Engelbart, inspired by Vannevar Bush's article "As We May Think," dedicated his life to using computers to expand human intelligence. After World War II, Engelbart earned a doctorate in computer science and worked at the Stanford Research Institute. Here, he developed many fundamental PC technologies, including the mouse, multiple windows, and interactive word processing. His 1968 demonstration, known as "The Mother of All Demos", showed these innovations and marked a turning point in the history of technology.
            Stewart Brand played an important role in technology inventions. Brand created the “Whole Earth Catalog,” a work that promoted tools for individual empowerment and environmental sustainability. Brand collaborated with Engelbart to demonstrate the NLS system, showing the potential of computers to improve collaboration and organization of information.
            
            Ed Roberts, another pioneer, made a significant impact with the creation of the Altair 8800, the first commercially available personal computer. In 1974, Roberts used the Intel 8080 microprocessor to design a computer accessible to hobbyists. The Altair 8800, with its 256 bytes of memory and input/output via toggle switches and flashing lights, was a big hit with coverage in "Popular Electronics" magazine. This success marked the beginning of the personal computer industry, making computer technology accessible to more users.
            
            Now, we use every day personal computers, laptops, tablets and smartphones. These devices offer instant access to information and communications.
            The contributions of pioneers like Engelbart, Brand, and Roberts transformed the PC into a symbol of innovation and progress, influencing our daily interaction with technology.
